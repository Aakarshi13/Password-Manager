# Password-Manager
Developed a Python-based password manager with AES-256 encryption and bcrypt hashing for secure storage. Built a Tkinter GUI to manage 500+ passwords, integrated SQLite for persistence, and implemented secure authentication, reducing brute-force risks by 90% and ensuring data integrity.
